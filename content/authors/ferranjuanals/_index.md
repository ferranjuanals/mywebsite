Studying biology has endowed me with a critical and analytical thinking that allows me to face problems in an organized and accurate manner. After a brief experience in the field of reproductive medicine, I studied a Masterâ€™s degree in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics to apply all my knowledge to real life situations. I worked as a Data Analyst at Health Engineering. Now, I am looking for new opportunities.
