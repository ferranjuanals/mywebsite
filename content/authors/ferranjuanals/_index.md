As a data analyst, I have always been a firm believer that we have progressed into an era where the importance of data-driven decisions give businesses the competitive advantage. The wonders of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning in solving business problems and improving the lives of consumers have always been a strong interest of mine.

As much as I love getting connected with the latest trend in AI and data science, I also love to disconnect from technology from time to time and appreciate the natural beauty our amazing Earth has to offer!
